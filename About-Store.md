## 🎨 Image Guidelines

### Requirements:
- **Quality:** High resolution, professional photography
- **Lighting:** Well-lit, vibrant colors work well
- **Composition:** Can be busy/detailed since it's used as background
- **Colors:** Warm, inviting tones preferred
- **Subject:** Store-related, spiritual items, or devotional theme

### Good Options:
1. **Product Display** - Books, murtis, and portraits arranged attractively
2. **Devotional Items** - Close-up of spiritual items with bokeh background
3. **Store Setting** - Clean, well-lit store area or preparation space
4. **Abstract/Pattern** - Spiritual symbols, mandala, or decorative patterns
5. **Haridham Interior** - Beautiful architectural or decorative elements

### What Works Best:
- Images with **good contrast** (will have dark overlay)
- **Warm colors** (oranges, golds, purples work well)
- **Interesting textures** or patterns
- **Professional quality** photography

## 🎯 Alternative Options

If you don't have a specific store image, you can use:
- **Same as Haridham evening image** from YDS Canada page
- **Interior mandir shot** with soft lighting
- **Abstract spiritual pattern** or mandala design
- **Gradient/solid color** (can skip image entirely)

To skip the image and use a pure gradient instead, you can remove or comment out the `<img>` tag in the code.

## 🔄 After Adding Image

1. Place image in `/web/public/` folder
2. The page automatically loads it (no restart needed usually)
3. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/about/store`
4. Scroll to bottom to see the final CTA section with your image
5. Check that the overlay looks good (text should be clearly visible)

**Note:** This is the only image needed for the About Store page. The page relies more on gradients, icons, and beautiful typography rather than photography.
